# matic build environment for glTF 1.0 Schema

This project uses Matic and a Pug template for generating HTML documentation for glTF Schema files.

## Dependencies
To build this documentation you will need to install the following two Node.js packages:

* [Matic](https://github.com/mattyod/matic)
* [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)

## Building the documentation
Details for building the glTF Schema documentation are provided on the [QtglTFTest wiki](https://github.com/WizzerWorks/QtglTFTest/wiki).

After following these instructions, you should now have a new folder called 'web' within the project. Within this folder should be a file called gltf.html, open this with a browser and view the generated documentation.

Please note this documentation is built to work as a simple local flat file system and so paths are not set as they would be if files were hosted on a server. That means you can just double click the generated HTML file and view it in your default browser.
